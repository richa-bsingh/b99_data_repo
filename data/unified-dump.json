          "You know how old people always have that gunk on them?",
          "Oldie gunk. Could be. Yeah. Anyone else?",
          "How about we focus on the murder,",

          "The next time I see you, I'd like you to be wearing a necktie.",
          "Oh, uh, actually,",
          "the last captain didn't care if we wore ties.",
          "Well, your new captain does.",
          "And more importantly, he cares that you follow his direct orders.",
          "Everyone.",
          "I'm your new Commanding Officer, Captain Ray Holt.",
          "Speech!",
          "That was my speech.",
          "Short and sweet.",
          "Sergeant Jeffords. A word.",

          "Though you were significantly...",
          "Fatter, sir. They called me Terry Titties.",
          "Because I had large, uh...",
          "Titties. Yes. I remember.",
          "I never liked that nickname.",
          "Though to be fair, it was accurate.",
          "What's this I hear about you being on administrative leave?",
          "A year ago, my wife and I had twin baby girls, uh...",
          "Cagney and Lacey.",
          "They have adorable chubby cheeks.",
          "Ever since, I kinda got scared of getting hurt.",
          "Lost my edge.",
          "There was an incident in a department store.",
          "Hey, man. You okay? You look a little jumpy.",
          "Oh, I'm fine. I'm fine.",
          "I think he's dead.",
          "And I'm still not right.",
          "Tell me about your detective squad.",
          "Um, well...",
          "Scully, Hitchcock, and Daniels.",
          "They're pretty much worthless.",
          "But they make good coffee.",
          "Copy that.",
          "Now the good ones.",
          "Rosa Diaz. Tough, smart, hard to read,",
          "and really scary.",
          "Tell me who has me for Secret Santa.",
          "No! That takes all the fun out of it.",
          "It's Scully.",
          "He got you a scarf.",
          "I'll make him return it.",
          "Yes, you will.",
          "Charles Boyle.",
          "He's a grinder. Not the most brilliant detective,",
          "but he works harder than anyone else.",
          "He's not physically",
          "gifted.",
          "Aw, man! My muffin!",
          "Ah!",
          "Ow, my head!",
          "My muffin and my head!",
          "And I stepped on... On my muffin, and my head and my muffin.",
          "JEFFORDS: Amy Santiago.",
          "She's got seven brothers.",
          "So she's always trying to prove she's tough.",
          "Be careful. That stuff's pretty hot.",
          "Oh, is it? Hmm?",
          "JEFFORDS: She and Peralta have some big bet over who gets more arrests this year.",
          "Ever since the bet, their numbers have gone way up.",
          "Tell me about Peralta.",
          "JEFFORDS: Jacob Peralta is my best detective.",
          "He likes putting away bad guys and he loves solving puzzles.",
          "The only puzzle he hasn't solved",
          "is how to grow up.",
          "That was very well put.",
          "I've talked a lot about Jake in my",
          "departmentally-mandated therapy sessions.",
          "Look, you know my history.",
          "You know how important this is to me.",
          "This precinct is doing fine.",
          "But I want to make it the best one in Brooklyn.",
          "And I need your help.",
          "Absolutely, sir.",
          "Where do we start?",
          "What is happening?",
          "We start with him.",
          "Okay. So the perp came in through the window, left the muddy red footprint,",
          "and apparently had sex with the dish rack.",
          "Shell casings found here.",
          "Two shots.",
          "Bang, bang. Great work, Detective.",
          "You get a tie. Hey, that's mine.",
          "You took it from my desk.",
          "That's right, Charles. Good solve. Tie for you.",
          "Thanks! Now everyone be sure to put those on, because it's",
          "impossible to solve crimes unless you're wearing a tie.",
          "Lay off the Captain.",
          "That man is gonna be my rabbi.",
          "Okay, first of all, when you use the word rabbi,",
          "you know that turns me on. And that's unfair in the work environment.",
          "Secondly, your rabbi is a pain in my ass.",
          "Yeah, he's a little too serious. What do you think, Rosa?",
          "Seems cool. Yeah, seems cool. I agree.",
          "Looks like the perp stole",
          "a computer, a watch, and a Jam?n lb?rico ham,",
          "valued at... What? $6,000.",
          "$6,000 for a ham?",
          "Jam?n lb?rico is an amazing cured ham from Spain.",
          "They had it at my uncle's funeral.",
          "I gorged myself at that funeral.",
          "I mean, I was constipated for three days.",
          "Wow. That's a great story, Charles. Thank you.",
          "All right, listen up, everybody.",
          "Better contact Captain Holt and let him know we got a ten-tie situation.",
          "Speaking of ties, where's yours, Meep-Morp?",
          "This is fantastic.",
          "Captain! Hey!",
          "Welcome to the murder.",
          "What are you doing here?",
          "I like to know what my detectives are up to.",
          "Is that okay by you? Yep.",
          "Take Santiago and knock on doors.",
          "See if the neighbors heard anything.",
          "Door duty? It's a waste of time.",
          "Diaz and Boyle, check in with the coroner. Report back to me in an hour.",
          "HOLT: No, it didn't.",
          "He's got like, super hearing.",
          "Hey, Rosa. Rosa, Rosa.",
          "Um...",
          "I just happened to notice that",
          "there's an old movie festival",
          "playing at the Film Forum this week.",
          "You want to go?",
          "Sure.",
          "Cool! Awesome.",
          "There's a bunch of movie options.",
          "I'll probably just go with something classic.",
          "Like Citizen Kane.",
          "Citizen Kane is terrible.",
          "Pick a good movie.",
          "Good call. Smart.",
          "I'll do it. I'll pick a better movie than",
          "Citizen Kane.",
          "So, Gina, civilian administrators like yourself",
          "often have their ear to the ground.",
          "What do Santiago and Peralta have riding on this bet of theirs?",
          "I will tell you on six conditions.",
          "Number one, you let me use your office to practice my dance moves.",
          "Second... How about this. If you tell me...",
          "Mmm-hmm? ...I won't have you suspended",
          "without pay. Oh, that sounds great!",
          "Okay, the deal is if Amy gets more arrests, Jake has to give her his car.",
          "It's an old Mustang. It's pretty sweet.",
          "If he gets more arrests, she has to go on a date with him.",
          "He guarantees",
          "it will end in sex.",
          "I'd bet on at least some over-the-clothes action.",
          "At the very least some touching.",
          "Oh, that's enough, Gina. Caresses...",
          "I could see him showing up in a silk robe...",
          "That's enough, Gina.",
          "All right. Thank you.",
          "PERALTA: Let the wasting of time begin.",
          "Hello, sir.",
          "May we ask you a few questions?",
          "Definitely. Yeah.",
          "I'm actually... I'm super glad you guys are here right now.",
          "Are you smelling that weed smell?",
          "Yeah. Yeah.",
          "'Cause a dude broke in, smoked weed, and bolted. It's...",
          "Do you think it's the same dude that left that bong there on the floor?",
          "Yes.",
          "Police.",
          "Hello. What's your name? Hello.",
          "My name? Mlepnos. Mmm-hmm.",
          "Can you spell that, please?",
          "M-L-E-P...",
          "Clay. Did you say Clay?",
          "Yes. The \"Clay\" is silent.",
          "All right. Got it.",
          "Have you seen this man before?",
          "He was shot last night.",
          "Oh!",
          "Thank you.",
          "No. Sir? That's ours. We need that.",
          "We... And he kept it.",
          "Wall Street Journal on the doormat, top floor apartment.",
          "20 bucks says this guy's like a hot, eligible bachelor.",
          "I'll take that action. Police, open up.",
          "Hello.",
          "Hello, sir! How are you today?",
          "I am Detective Right-All-The-Time,",
          "and this is my partner, Detective Terrible-Detective.",
          "No surprises from the coroner.",
          "Two gunshots, shoulder and chest.",
          "None of the neighbors heard or saw anything.",
          "And what's worse, Santiago struck out with a 92-year-old.",
          "That is not accurate, sir.",
          "Wait, you hooked up with him? Ugh!",
          "All right. Hit the pawnshops and canvas the neighborhood.",
          "And while you're out, you can buy yourself a tie.",
          "Oh, actually, sir...",
          "I'm wearing a tie right now.",
          "Check it out!",
          "Secret tie!",
          "First of all, I think you're kind of overdoing it with the manscaping.",
          "But more importantly, Detective,",
          "why do you refuse to take my orders seriously?",
          "Does anyone here know why it's so important to me",
          "that you all dress appropriately?",
          "Hmm. Four highly-trained detectives and not one of you can solve this simple mystery.",
          "Okay, I want to be briefed on any new developments.",
          "Any questions? I was gonna ask you if you thought I was doing too much",
          "manscaping, but we solved that one, so I'm good. Mmm-hmm.",
          "Hey, Boyle. Yeah?",
          "What about this fancy ham stuff? Jam?n lb?rico?",
          "Yes. The perp left a really expensive TV,",
          "but then stole ham? It doesn't make sense.",
          "Is there a place nearby the crime scene that sells it?",
          "Beneficio's might. Let's go.",
          "You're gonna brief the CO first.",
          "We'll brief him after we catch the guy.",
          "My name is Ratko.",
          "I don't know anything. Oh.",
          "Okay. You recognize this guy?",
          "Henry Morgenthau?",
          "No.",
          "Maybe, actually...",
          "Look at the picture? I don't know him.",
          "I don't know what happened.",
          "No more questions!",
          "Well, why don't I run a scenario past you, Ratko,",
          "and you tell me what you think?",
          "You do know Morgenthau. He came in here and tried to sell you some hams.",
          "You knew they were worth a lot of money,",
          "so you tried to steal them from him when he wasn't home.",
          "Only he was home, so you shot him.",
          "Does that sound familiar?",
          "Uh, maybe some role-play will jog your memory?",
          "That's a great idea. Okay. Yeah.",
          "Uh, so I'm... I'm Ratko. No, no. I'm Ratko.",
          "Come on. I'm always the victim. So...",
          "Look, I'm not doing this with you right here.",
          "Fine. Fine.",
          "Oh, I'm Henry Morgenthau, owner of delicious and expensive hams.",
          "Don't I know you from the grocery store? Kill.",
          "And scene.",
          "PERALTA: NYPD. Everyone, down!",
          "Ma'am, if you could just get down.",
          "Or ignore me and continue shopping.",
          "Boyle, get the door! BOYLE: On it.",
          "Ratko?",
          "PERALTA: Back up.",
          "Whoa. Whoa, whoa.",
          "Ow! Ratko! I'm getting mad!",
          "That's a waste of Manchego!",
          "Charles!",
          "How are you still here?",
          "Jake! Little help?",
          "Ratko!",
          "We're not going anywhere, Jake.",

          "You're NYPD, you're supposed to be hostages.",
          "Supposed to be.",
          "But we rose up and took down the terrorists.",
          "That's right. We're the bad guys now.",
          "Is this some sort of game to you?",
          "Does this sound like a game?",
          "I am a terrorist leader. My name is Francis Gruber.",

          "- Drill's over, boys. - Yeah, that sounds right.",
          "We're not on the same level.",
          "And apparently, you're at the level that can't handle us.",
          "You trying to goad me, Peralta?",
          "'Cause I'm in charge here and I don't have",
          "to engage with mall cops.",

          "I'm in. What are your demands?",
          "A guarantee that this drill doesn't end",
          "until one of us is dead.",
          "Also, one large pizza with fennel sausage.",
          "Brick oven, otherwise it's sog city.",
          "And Scully needs some Gas-o-nex.",
          "Extra strength.",
          "Okay, so a fight to the death, pizza and Gas-o-nex.",
          "You have 30 minutes to meet our demands.",
          "After that, we paint ball a hostage every 15 minutes.",
          "Got yourself a deal, Gruber.",
          "Get us those demands. We'll be waiting.",
          "We're not waiting one second.",
          "Those demands were a ruse.",
          "They were? I really need that Gas-o-nex.",

          "and square blondies, you opt for the cookie.",
          "You opt for the circle.",

          "I'm choosing a cookie over a blondie.",

          "Hey, Gina!",
          "What are you guys talking about? Yogurt? Me too.",
          "Let's keep talking about that.",
          "Whoo!",
          "Terry's out of breath.",
          "Cool. I was just dropping off some files.",
          "Great, let's just go out to your desk",
          "and let's talk about how that went.",
          "Okay, Terry.",
          "But first, I want to ask the captain",
          "for his impresh of my show.",
          "Got any feed-b, or was it just love, love, love?",
          "Well, actually...",
          "I thought it was amazing!",
          "You were like a swan who went to Juilliard.",
          "It was so good.",
          "Terry, I have already received your praise.",
          "I'm clearly fishing in another pond right now.",
          "I'm putting an end to this.",
          "Sergeant Jeffords and I",
          "were unable to attend your performance.",
          "Oh.",
          "r compliments.",
          "Terry is a practiced liar.",
          "I'm sorry we missed the show.",
          "I know that dancing is an important hobby to you.",
          "Hobby?",
          "You think my dancing is a hobby?",
          "Oh, yes.",
          "Like me and antique globe collecting.",
          "It's thrilling, but nobody is ever going to pay me for it.",
          "Ergo, a hobby.",
          "I get paid...",
          "in applause.",
          "But apparently not yours.",
          "I know that maintaining integrity can be difficult,",
          "but in the long run,",
          "everyone is better for it.",
          "Attention everyone.",
          "The tragic sound you hear is the shredding of my spandie.",
          "Gina Linetti will never dance again.",
          "So those threatening phone calls",
          "were being made to Tim Orsk",
          "of Tim O's Limos.",
          "That's interesting.",
          "This Orsk guy's name keeps cropping up in this case.",
          "'Cause he's the victim.",
          "You know, he's the guy whose window",
          "was smashed with this rock.",
          "Okay?",
          "He's being extorted for $10,000.",
          "Sure, but what do they want from him?",
          "$10,000.",
          "I just said that.",
          "We're trying to figure out who's doing the threatening.",
          "Wait. I have a theory.",
          "I think \"limousine\" and \"magazine\"",
          "come from the same word.",
          "Just focus!",
          "I'm sorry for snapping.",
          "I interviewed Orsk...",
          "Orsk! There it is again.",
          "Oh, you're useless!",
          "You're completely useless!",
          "You are without a doubt the most incompetent detectives",
          "I've ever seen.",
          "And I'm including that bomb-sniffing dog",
          "who humps all the bombs!",
          "You know your turning signal's been on for 30 seconds.",
          "I like to announce my turning intention.",
          "This isn't the Indy 500.",
          "Well, when you finally change lanes an hour from now,",
          "we should go talk to Jake's super...",
          "see if there was a power outage.",
          "What?",
          "Oh!",
          "Why would you do that?",
          "I just broke into your car",
          "and then popped up without warning.",
          "Not cool.",
          "What the hell are you doing?",
          "I thought I was hitching a ride to Rikers",
          "so we could interview some convicts I put away,",
          "but apparently you're still wasting time investigating me.",
          "Hey, it's your fault we have to check up on your power outages.",
          "You have three mini-fridges plugged in to the same outlet.",
          "Three mini-fridges are cheaper than one regular one.",
          "We're just doing our jobs.",
          "Why don't you trust us?",
          "How can I?",
          "You didn't even know a man",
          "was lying in the backseat of your car.",
          "And while you two were busy lolly-gargling...",
          "I'm not familiar with the expression...",
          "I was investigating. I'll send you some selfies.",
          "Look, we're gonna get to your list.",
          "We just have to rule out other possibilities first.",
          "You know, there is a real chance",
          "that no one is after you.",
          "Yeah, but I'm telling you that someone is.",
          "That should be enough.",
          "And we told you to trust us.",
          "That should be enough.",
          "All right, fine. You don't want my help?",
          "You're not gonna get it.",
          "Dude...",
          "In fact, I'm deleting your numbers from my phone.",
          "Just let us take you home.",

          "I'm just ruining your life like you ruined mine.",
          "You never should have arrested me.",
          "But I basically got your cocaine charges dropped.",
          "You only had to do 40 hours of community service.",
          "Right, but I wanted to get them all done at once,",
          "so for energy, I did way too much cocaine and meth.",
          "Went on a prolonged psychotic episode",
          "involving assault, public fornication,",
          "and, apparently, the touching of my scrotum",
          "to every doorknob in a synagogue.",
          "And you know what happened then?",
          "They thoroughly cleaned the synagogue,",
          "you landed on your feet",
          "and pursued your true passion of selling ice cream?",
          "None of that.",
          "I lost my job and my wife and my home.",
          "An ex-client lent me this truck.",

          "on a strangle-and-mangle.",
          "You have a phrase for that?",
          "I used to, when I was an awesome lawyer.",
          "Now I'm just another idiot living in an ice cream truck.",
          "So that's why you put drugs in my urine.",
          "Hey, that was my urine.",
          "Your urine is in there.",
          "Why would you keep my pee?",
          "I need belongings, Jake,",
          "to feel like a man.",
          "Look, this is a bad idea, Hoytsman.",
          "People are gonna notice if I disappear.",
          "See? Someone's already looking for me.",
          "You're in big trouble, buddy.",
          "Your e-coupon for Big Mike's Calzones expires today.",
          "You're damn right.",
          "And if I don't redeem that,",
          "Big Mike is gonna get real suspicious.",
          "Big Mike is a cartoon",
          "with pizzas for eyes.",
          "All right, fine.",
          "Maybe not Big Mike, but someone will.",
          "Shut up, Peralta!",
          "Oh, boy.",
          "Captain Holt,",
          "here's your CompStat report.",
          "This is how I move now.",
          "Walking is too close to dancing,",
          "and there's no more dance in me.",
          "Plus I'm hoping my leg muscles will atrophy",
          "so I won't be tempted to use them.",
          "I bet you feel real good about calling her dancing hobby, huh?",
          "Sarcasm... the coward's lie.",
          "I don't get it.",
          "Gina's always so sure of herself.",
          "She usually doesn't care at all",
          "what people say or think about her.",
          "Maybe not with most people, Captain.",
          "But she cares what you think.",
          "Fine. I regret what I said.",
          "But now, I don't know how to make it right with her.",
          "Lie!",
          "Look, yesterday I told my twins",
          "there were baby bunnies in their stomachs",
          "to get them to eat lettuce.",
          "And that worked?",
          "Yeah, but then they refused to drink their milk",
          "because they thought the bunnies would drown.",
          "So I bought a couple rabbits and told the girls",
          "that they hopped out of their mouths while they slept.",
          "I've lost track of your point.",
          "They ate their lettuce,",
          "I'm stuck with two bunnies,",

          "A prostitute taught me how to make it.",
          "Ugh. Where were you?",
          "You were gone for three hours.",
          "I know because I sang \"This Is How We Do It\" 143 times.",
          "Okay, well, I had to grab a few things at the art supply store.",
          "Kidnapping is 90% crafting.",
          "Jake, you're gonna help me get my life back.",
          "You're gonna confess, on video,",
          "to framing me for everything that got me in trouble.",
          "And why would I do that?",
          "Because I'm high on bath salts,",
          "emotionally unstable,",
          "and pointing a gun at you.",
          "Let's make a movie!",
          "Hey, Boyle,",

          "You called us zeros in the sack.",
          "Never happened.",
          "Well, someone said it to me last night.",
          "Oh, uh, must have been my wife.",
          "How did you solve the case?",
          "We listened to those voicemails again",
          "and noticed the sound of parrots in the background.",
          "Got a list of employees, did door duty",
          "asking neighbors if any of them kept pet birds.",
          "We finally found one who did, and guess what.",
          "The landscaping in front of his building was covered with these.",
          "Same type of rock that was thrown through the window.",
          "I can't believe it.",
          "What, you don't think it could break one?",
          "Watch.",
          "I meant I can't believe you solved the case.",
          "Well, you were wrong on that too.",
          "Hi. My name is Jake Peralta,",
          "and this is my confession.",

          "You've been very naughty.",

          "\"Starts crying\" is a stage direction,",
          "you imbecile!",
          "Also, I fathered two children with Hoytsman's cleaning lady,",
          "and it was I, disguised as Geoffrey,",
          "who spoke against her at her political asylum hearing.",
          "God.",
          "You did it, not me.",
          "I am a horrible person who has done horrible things",

          "Whoa!",
          "I got him.",
          "- Look what I found. - French fries?",
          "What? No, it's Hitchcock.",
          "Where would I have found French fries in a weed farm?",
          "Oh, man, look at him. This is bad.",

          "Aw, Wednesdays.",
          "Who are you again?",

          "Starting to?",
          "What have you been doing for the past hour?",

          "Deeply chagrined.",
          "I finally understand the old adage, \"Never meet your heroes.\"",

          "and then they're gonna rip your tongue out!",
          "No. That's my cupcake taster!",
          "What are you doing? Lay off him!",
          "Never! For my plan to work, he's gotta be basting in sweat.",
          "Hitchcock, you once told me you could roll that chair anywhere.",
          "Think you could take it up those stairs?",
          "I once rode a chair home in a blizzard.",
          "So, yeah, I can go up stairs.",
          "So do it.",

          "You know, in case he starts acting...",
          "Bat crap loony tunes. Yes.",
          "You can use your powers to keep him in check.",
          "Yeah, people fear me. Mm.",
          "The only reason I'm not your boss right now",
          "is 'cause I'd hate to do that to Holt.",
          "He needs this. And also you're not a cop.",
          "Well, you're not the basis of a character on \"empire,\"",
          "Jake, but I don't throw that in your face every damn day.",
          "So you will come with us? Yeah, I'll be there.",
          "You da man! Bye, girl!",
          "See ya in the car, girl.",
          "Okay. First, the good news.",
          "I've generated a detailed timeline broken down",
          "into 30-second increments to keep us on track.",
          "We're already 16.5 increments",
          "behind schedule. Oh, man.",
          "Terry feels overwhelmed.",
          "Good! Use it!",
          "Neil Armstrong was overwhelmed when he walked on the moon,",
          "but you know what he did?",
          "He walked on the moon!",
          "Charles, you're in charge of food.",
          "I've been planning a nuptial menu",
          "since the day I met Genevieve.",
          "Warning, it will be delicious and highly erotic.",
          "Your menu is not gonna involve animal genitalia, is it?",
          "No, I was gonna make... Not that.",
          "Terry, you're on hair and makeup.",
          "I've seen your little girls' pigtails,",
          "so I know you can do it.",
          "They actually prefer my hair work to their mommy's.",
          "I love their little heads.",
          "Terry, what's going on, man?",
          "It's just a matter of time before I'm doing their hair",
          "at their weddings.",
          "It goes so fast. They're still babies!",
          "Pull it together, Jeffords!",
          "Scully and Hitchcock, you're in charge of seating.",
          "Smart move, Amy. I've been called",
          "the Leonardo da Vinci of sitting on my ass.",
          "Great.",
          "And, captain, you can help me decorate.",
          "I'm at your disposal, just tell me what to do.",
          "I'm here to implement your vision.",
          "Well, we just wanna keep it classy.",
          "Got it. Balloon arch.",
          "What? Say no more, it's done.",
          "I'm off to the nearest balloon store.",
          "Okay, Rosa.",
          "You go to the office, have a couple bellinis,",
          "and just relax. What's a Bellini?",
          "Peach juice and champagne.",
          "Peach juice and champagne? What am I, six?",
          "Come on, just try it.",
          "It's what Nancy Meyers would drink.",
          "Fine. For Nancy.",
          "So, big day. How you feeling, buddy?",
          "Good, giddy.",
          "I've never felt giddy before.",
          "Didn't realize how close it was to hungry.",
          "You know, it's possible you're just hungry.",
          "When's the last time you ate? Uh, three days ago?",
          "Ah. You excited for being married?",
          "Yeah! I love Rosa.",
          "I can't wait to just jam my tongue in her earholes,",
          "and eat the hair off her head.",
          "Hoo! I'm giddy. Aw, that's cute.",
          "All right, we're looking for 381 Smith street.",
          "It should be up here.",
          "Hopefully they still have your earrings.",
          "You sure we're looking for 381?",
          "'Cause 381's looking a little crispy.",
          "Oh, no. It burned down.",
          "How did this happen?",
          "Uh, it's okay. Everything's gonna be fine.",
          "We'll think of something, all right?",
          "Nope!",
          "This is a sign from the universe.",
          "I can't marry Rosa.",
          "Guys, the wedding's off.",
          "This is a disaster. Come on.",
          "I mean, they're just earrings, right?",
          "We can get another pair, or we could make some new ones.",
          "All we need is, like, a blacksmith.",
          "Or a smelter... a smelt man. That can't be right.",
          "The point is you can still married.",
          "No, Jake. You don't understand.",
          "The universe is sending me a sign.",
          "And when the universe talks, I listen!",
          "Well, I personally don't even really believe in signs, so...",
          "What? Then you deserve to die.",
          "Ah... The sign was real.",
          "If I ignore it and marry Rosa anyway,",
          "I'm basically asking the universe to stomp on my balls.",
          "Okay, good point.",
          "Hey, Gina, I could use your help here.",
          "You wanna maybe weigh in on this one?",
          "Yeah, sure.",
          "You're right. The marriage is cursed.",
          "What? No! You weighed in wrong.",
          "I'm sorry, Jake, it's an omen.",
          "And I'm not taking your side against the universe's.",
          "It's hundred of years old. What if there was something",
          "in the universe that could prove to you that you",
          "should still get married? What would that be?",
          "Finding his grandma's earrings.",
          "Or we could cut Rosa's ears off, and then it's like",
          "the earrings don't even make sense.",
          "Thank you! Someone's trying to help.",
          "Okay, so the earrings.",
          "Maybe somebody bought them",
          "before the place burned down, right?",
          "We could track 'em down.",
          "And lookee here.",
          "I just got the owner's name. That's good, right?",
          "Okay, maybe there is a little bit of hope.",
          "You're damn right there is.",
          "Suck it, universe!",
          "Are you crazy? Why would you even say that?",
          "Come on, man!",
          "How are the chairs coming, guys?",
          "Shh. We're working!",
          "This one's good. Okay.",
          "So we'll go with that one? No, I said it was good.",
          "I didn't say it was right.",
          "Wow, you're taking this really seriously.",
          "Amy, will you taste this batter?",
          "Mm-hmm.",
          "Hmm... I think it's a little off.",
          "You know what's off? Your mouth!",
          "Why Jake lets your stupid tongue anywhere near him,",
          "I'll never know.",
          "Nope, I forgot the sugar. That's on me.",
          "Whoa, you really made the balloon arch.",
          "Made? No. I birthed her.",
          "There's no form more graceful than the arch,",
          "no object more whimsical than the balloon.",
          "Yes, you and I think that, but...",
          "What will Rosa think?",
          "Good point.",
          "Rosa would want a much, much bigger balloon arch.",
          "Back to the balloon store.",
          "Uh, Amy? We've got a problem.",
          "What? Rosa's drunk.",
          "Rosa? No. How?",
          "Bellinis rule!",
          "Nancy Meyers, you've done it again, you saucy bitch.",
          "For the last time, I don't have your earrings.",
          "They didn't survive the fire.",
          "Aw, no, this is really bad.",
          "Well, not necessarily. I mean, maybe the universe",
          "allowed something else to survive, you know?",
          "Like a rabbit's foot. I don't think you understand",
          "how pawn shops work. I don't think you understand",
          "how they work. Yours burned down!",
          "I'm so sorry you lost everything.",
          "I'm just really worked up. No, please don't!",
          "Okay, so...",
          "I know that seemed like a little bit of a dead end.",
          "She's got the earrings.",
          "She does? She stole all the merch,",
          "and then burned down the store.",
          "She was wearing a necklace that I also pawned there.",
          "Oh, snap! Signs on signs on signs!",
          "Are you sure it's the same necklace?",
          "Uh, yeah, Jake. I once punched it",
          "through a guy's throat, so I'm pretty sure",
          "I remember it. I stand corrected.",
          "All right, I'm gonna call the local police",
          "and get a warrant. Oh, don't bother.",
          "Let's just kick down the door, and take back what's mine.",
          "No! No, no, no. That's a bad idea.",
          "He's right. Just use the lattice.",
          "The upstairs window's open.",
          "No! Nice!",
          "What are you doing? I'm trying to make",
          "this wedding happen. What are you doing?",
          "Trying to keep us out of prison.",
          "You know what, forget it. I'll just deal with him myself...",
          "Nope, he's already on the roof.",
          "Aha! Yeah, dog! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!",
          "Rosa, what happened? Sorry.",
          "I didn't know you could drunk off champers.",
          "I mean, it's half bubbles. Don't worry, Amy.",
          "I got this. I'm a master at sobering up.",
          "Are you sure? Uh, you don't go",
          "to the renaissance faire every weekend in your 20s",
          "without learning how to handle your mead.",
          "Great. Thanks, Charles.",
          "Mm-hmm.",
          "Charles, I'm getting married today.",
          "Yes, you are.",
          "And I'm gonna make sure you are sober",
          "when that happens. Now I just need cayenne pepper",
          "and some horse milk. Marriage is the best.",
          "Hey, how come you and Genevieve aren't married?",
          "Huh? Uh...",
          "You know, it's complicated. No, it's not.",
          "It's easy. Bring her down here.",
          "We'll all get married! Yeah, right.",
          "She doesn't want that. Whoa, that sounds...",
          "No, no, no, no, no, no.",
          "No, no, no. Uh-uh, no, no.",
          "Everything's great with us.",
          "I mean, if it was up to me, we'd get hitched,",
          "but she had a really bad divorce, so...",
          "Oh, I'm sorry. Does that upset you?",
          "I'm good! Yeah, I'm good!",
          "I'm so sad.",
          "I love her so much.",
          "I wanna marry her butt so bad.",
          "To Genevieve's butt! To Genevieve's butt!",
          "Look at all this crap. See, I told you.",
          "They took all their merchandise, and burned their store.",
          "This is a bad idea. We should leave now.",
          "What? No. All we're gonna do",
          "is find the earrings,",
          "and then light this place on fire for revenge.",
          "Check it out! Rainstick.",
          "Keeping it. No, you're not.",
          "That is a crime. Untrue.",
          "Once you steal something,",
          "none of your stuff belongs to you.",
          "I've heard that too. No, you haven't.",
          "No one has. Put that down.",
          "Okay.",
          "Gina! Be a quieter robber!",
          "But you told me to put it down.",
          "Hi, we met earlier.",
          "You're breaking into my house?",
          "Or are you breaking into our house?",
          "Yeah. Dino! Robbers! Dino!",
          "Aha! I found the earrings!",
          "Dino! Get up here!",
          "Yeah, Dino! Get in here!",
          "So you can watch me light your house on fire!",
          "Whoa! Okay, everybody, just keep it cool.",
          "Everybody be chilly chill chill.",
          "I am gonna slice your face off!",
          "Not chill, Dino.",
          "Let me in there, you sons of bitches!",
          "Wait, wait!",
          "The trellis won't hold all three of us at the same time.",
          "Smart.",
          "Whoo! Ooh!",
          "That was awesome! I love being a police officer!",
          "That was the opposite of being a police officer.",
          "We just robbed somebody. Who robbed us!",
          "The universe is back on track, baby!",
          "We got grandma's earrings back!",
          "And the rainstick!",
          "Which you will be returning. Uh, sure I will.",
          "How are we doing on traffic?",
          "Green all the way. All right, looks like",
          "we're actually gonna make it in time for this wedding.",
          "Thank you, universe.",
          "Thank you for blessing this marriage.",
          "Okay, I know what you're thinking,",
          "but this is not a sign.",
          "I just have to pump the gas twice, and turn it back on.",
          "This happens all the time.",
          "Do you know where your dad hides his pot? Yep. Damn it.",
          "The universe doesn't want me to marry Rosa.",
          "Look, it's gonna be fine.",
          "We'll get the car fixed and make it back in time.",
          "Gina, when's the tow truck getting here?",
          "No idea, I'm talking to my spiritual advisor.",
          "He says we have an engine problem.",
          "Yeah, I know, that's why I said call a tow truck!",
          "So you meant my spiritual advisor is right?",
          "Guys! This is my fault. I should've just given up",
          "when fate burned down the pawn shop, okay?",
          "Stupid Adrian. Stupid Adrian!",
          "Idiot! Read the signs! Enough!",
          "I'm so sick of this garbage, all right?",
          "The two of you need to stop",
          "looking for signs everywhere... Oh, my god, a sign.",
          "Whoo! He can fly! Prop planes!",
          "You can fly, you can fly!",
          "I'm a vessel for the universe.",
          "Wow. The chairs look amazing.",
          "I can't believe you two aren't my biggest problem today.",
          "We're not? Who is?",
          "My arch. Isn't she beautiful?",
          "I got eye-rolled to, not about!",
          "While Pimento stares at Rosa,",
          "we'll all be staring at... Her.",
          "Yes, we will. She's truly breathtaking.",
          "There's a double meaning to that.",
          "The breath that it takes to inflate all those balloons.",
          "Of course I used the hand pump, but the bon mot still works.",
          "Oh, no! What's happening?",
          "Someone tell me what's happening.",
          "I got some more bad news. Oh.",
          "Oh, wow. That thing's huge.",
          "Didn't Rosa want things to be classy?",
          "I mean, she's getting married, not finishing a marathon.",
          "So says the hair guy.",
          "Stay in your Lane, bucko. Right, Santiago?",
          "The arch sucks! I'm sorry.",
          "I didn't want to say anything because you're my boss",
          "and you were so excited, but the truth is every time",
          "I look at it I wanna die and take you with me.",
          "Well, I wish you'd said something",
          "before I spent all day making it.",
          "Of course, you didn't want to...",
          "\"Burst my bubble.\" Pun intended.",
          "And then... You did.",
          "Forget the arch! Charles didn't sober up Rosa.",
          "She got him drunk! Oh, no.",
          "How drunk is he?",
          "Remember the night they cancelled \"bunheads\"?",
          "We're ruined. It's fine.",
          "I'll handle it. You got your hands full.",
          "Yeah.",
          "This is just 18 shots of Espresso.",
          "It got me through the first three months of having twins,",
          "but I imagine it'll sober you up too.",
          "Aww, he's taking care of you.",
          "Such a good father.",
          "Ugh, I miss my father.",
          "I used to be daddy's little girl, but we never talk anymore.",
          "You don't? That's what happens.",
          "You grow up, your bond with your dad goes...",
          "No, it doesn't always happen.",
          "All right, not to special daddies who put the time in.",
          "You know, read them stories, do their little pigtails.",
          "Really, sarge?",
          "Who do you think used to do my pigtails?",
          "Why can't they stay babies forever?",
          "Berlini!",
          "Bellini! Bellini!",
          "Okay, this is very scary,",
          "but it's okay, because you're a trained pilot.",
          "No, I'm not. I'm self-taught.",
          "What? Oh, yeah.",
          "You can learn anything online.",
          "Ooh, you should see me do origami.",
          "Oh, do you know how to do a frog?",
          "Oh, no!",
          "Can you do a swan? No.",
          "Can you do a crane? What's a crane?",
          "Okay, he does not know how to fly a plane.",
          "All right, food is ready, decorations are set,",
          "guests should start arriving any moment,",
          "and the chairs are still perfection.",
          "She said they're perfection. I'm so proud of you, buddy.",
          "It was you. You made this happen.",
          "All right! Let's show Rosa what we got.",
          "Wait. Where is Rosa?",
          "Narc.",
          "And that's why you shouldn't drink.",
          "Being drunk sounds terrible.",
          "Hello, Amy, I didn't see you there.",
          "How did the wedding go? Terry!",
          "What the hell, man? You said you were gonna",
          "sober them up. It was her fault.",
          "My girls are never gonna grow up and lose their virginity.",
          "I lost my v-card to the woman",
          "that refilled Nana's oxygen tanks.",
          "Her hands were so strong from turning the nozzles.",
          "This is a room of nightmares.",
          "You're the nightmare.",
          "You made me kill my balloon baby.",
          "Look at me.",
          "So drunk, I'm alliterating like a beatnik.",
          "Okay, everybody outside now!",
          "Just know that you brought this on yourselves.",
          "Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait!",
          "Can't we just go to sleep for a winker?",
          "We're way past winkers.",
          "Scully, Hitchcock, bring the frost.",
          "No!",
          "Nice job, you two.",
          "We are nailing it today!",

          "I know, and I apologize, but I'm executing a strategy.",
          "Oh, really, and what strategy might that be?",
          "Make Jake feel like an idiot,",
          "or make Jake feel self-conscious",

          "This is crazy.",
          "Why don't you have a backup key, Terry?",
          "The dealer tried charging me an extra $300 for it.",
          "I told him I didn't want it",
          "because Terry never loses his keys.",

          "And let's not rule out the real possibility that it's entirely sexual.",
          "Oh, man. That will be super-upsetting and so cool.",
          "I know it's amazing... Okay, okay. Focus up.",
          "Let's do this. Right. You look great.",
          "NYPD.",
          "Hello? Is there a problem?",
          "We're looking for Frank Gillespie.",
          "Frank? He died a year ago.",
          "What? What happened? Well, his lymphoma came back.",
          "But really, it was the loneliness that killed him.",
          "Somebody hurt him, and he just",
          "couldn't make friends after that.",
          "So it seems like he died because of me.",

          "He lives right around here too.",
          "So? He hated me.",
          "What if this is the work of my arch-nemesis and not yours?",
          "So you're suggesting I'm not involved in this at all?",
          "I mean, you hear yourself, right?",
          "That's a bit of a stretch. Yeah, Amy.",

          "What are you doing here? How'd you get past the police barricade?",
          "Well, I moved them.",
          "Now, I know I was supposed to come here solo,",

          "Barb can't be here. You can't just add someone day of.",

          "Okay, Aunt Linda, I love you but you gotta go.",
          "Okay? Thank you. Give us a moment here.",
          "All right, Dario, tell Lieutenant Wells",
          "what you told us.",
          "Okay, I've hated Detective Santiago",
          "since she arrested me, and then I saw",
          "that engagement announcement in the paper.",
          "But you could have figured out where the wedding was",
          "even without that, right?",
          "No, I was trying.",
          "I had totally given up, really.",
          "Oh, God, what have I done?",
          "Anyway, I made the threat, but there's no bomb.",
          "Just like I've been saying all along.",
          "Now, can we please go back in the venue?",
          "First of all, there's nothing inherently creepy",
          "about a wall of Amy photos.",
          "Uh-huh. Secondly,",
          "I'm not gonna just take this guy's word",
          "for it that there's no bomb.",
          "Why not? He's the one who would know.",
          "So you think a cop should just stop what they're doing",
          "as soon as a criminal tells them they didn't do it?",
          "Oh, my God! That is actually a really good point.",
          "So I only had one passenger after you, and he got off here.",
          "Well, what did he look like? I don't know.",
          "I mean, he was wearing some dumb hat.",
          "I'm sorry, I know that's not helpful...",
          "All hats are dumb.",
          "Ha!",
          "What the hell? Is that your laugh?",
          "Also, quit vibing, and help me solve this.",
          "Sorry, man. It's what the universe wants.",
          "Screw the universe. The universe is a dick.",
          "Maybe it fell out when he got out of the car.",
          "Wow, you are so smart.",
          "Oh, oh, yep, yep, yep. Here it is.",
          "Uh-oh. It's kind of dirty-looking.",
          "But, you know, that's why they put it in a dry cleaning bag.",
          "I'm sure everything inside is totally...",
          "Nope. Soaked in urine.",
          "Damn it, New York.",
          "Kay, you've been staring at your phone for 45 minutes.",
          "Just read the email. What if it's bad news?",
          "Sir, do you know how many times",
          "I've not gotten something that I wanted?",
          "How many? Zero.",
          "Because I have a trick.",
          "Whatever that email says,",
          "you just act like that's what you wanted all along.",
          "Well, I can't fake it. I want this job.",
          "For years, I've worked nights and weekends.",
          "I've sacrificed friendships.",
          "I've jeopardized my relationship with Kevin.",
          "And now,",
          "to find out if it was all in vain.",
          "Yeah, let's not check it.",
          "It feels like there's a lot on the line.",
          "Agreed. Let's just grab Cheddar and go to the wedding.",
          "Where is he? Cheddar?",
          "Cheddar!",
          "Cheddar the dog!",
          "Oh, he ate the cake.",
          "Oh, Cheddar, you furry little pig.",
          "Okay, Amy.",
          "I got through every room and I cleared them very fast,",
          "because I love you and I want you to be happy,",
          "even if it's with somebody else.",
          "Did that new tactic work? No.",
          "You just called it a tactic.",
          "Can we get in the venue or not?",
          "Not quite yet. There's one more vent",
          "we can't get into, and our snake cam broke.",
          "We got another one on the way. It'll be here in about six hours.",
          "What? No. We need it now.",
          "People are already here. I'm sorry.",
          "The vent is very tight, and no one",
          "on my team can get into it.",
          "I've been doing a lot of Pilates",
          "so I'm pretty huge at this point.",
          "I'm going in.",
          "What? Look, this is all my fault.",
          "I put the announcement in the paper",
          "and ruined this day.",
          "And now I'm gonna be the one to fix it.",
          "Get ready, you two.",
          "I'm about to save this...",
          "Bomb! There's a bomb!",
          "Damn it, Dario. Why'd you say there was no bomb?",
          "Because I wanted to kill Amy.",
          "Then why did you call in the threat?",
          "I didn't. My daughter found my hidden room",
          "and discovered some blueprints.",
          "Yes, fine, Teddy. You were right.",
          "Now can you please get the bomb out of the vent",
          "and dispose of it somewhere?",
          "Honestly, I wish we could.",
          "But it's too dangerous to move.",
          "We have to diffuse it on site.",
          "I have to evacuate this entire block.",
          "It's gonna take all night. Wait, so you're saying...",
          "Wedding's off. For real, it's over.",
          "Jakey, what's this that I hear that there's no rabbi?",
          "Not now, Aunt Linda!",
          "Okay, so we just finished processing Moretti.",
          "Did you talk to our parents? Yeah.",
          "They ended up having dinner together.",
          "It sounded like they had fun. Our dads only got in one arm-wrestling match.",
          "Who won? Neither.",
          "They both threw out their shoulders.",
          "What a disaster.",
          "Yeah. But, look, I know",
          "it seems like everything sucks, but",
          "why don't we just get married tomorrow?",
          "You know, we won't have a venue or a band",
          "or any of our guests, but we could go to city hall.",
          "Jake, do you really want to get married",
          "in the same place people go to get restraining orders?",
          "Amy Santiago, I would marry you any time, any place.",
          "I would marry you in the steaming filth of the Gowanus Canal.",
          "Sweet. But also, gross.",
          "I would marry you on the G Train in the summertime",
          "when the air conditioning is broken.",
          "Damn, really?",
          "I would marry you on top of the Empire State Building.",
          "Well, that sounds kind of nice.",
          "During a King Kong attack.",
          "Oh, yeah, that's not good.",
          "Okay. City hall it is.",
          "No! I was eavesdropping.",
          "I'm always eavesdropping. I don't like it.",
          "Look, I didn't spend the last seven years",
          "watching your love ripen, only to have it",
          "sullied by a city hall wedding.",
          "You're getting married right here, right now.",
          "What? Come on.",
          "Boyle, I don't even have a dress.",
          "You can wear Gina's. I'm sure it's white.",
          "There's no way Gina was gonna wear",
          "a white dress to my wedding.",
          "No, I definitely was.",
          "What? I thought you'd just wear",
          "a grey pantsuit or something.",
          "I would never wear a grey pantsuit to your wedding,",
          "I promise you that.",
          "This is happening. Jake and Amy are getting married tonight.",
          "Title of my sex tape! What?",
          "Whoo! Yeah. Whoo. All right.",
          "I got a lot to work. Lot of work...",
          "What... Give me a half hour! Whoa!",
          "Wow. You look beautiful.",
          "Thank you. This dress is incredible.",
          "Gina, this would have been so crazy",
          "if you wore this to our wedding.",
          "I know.",
          "Hey, Amy, I know I ruined your veil,",
          "but I made you a new one.",
          "It's a shower curtain. Uhh...",
          "Yep, Terry fumbled the task.",
          "But we got you a bouquet.",
          "Wow. That's gorgeous.",
          "Thank you. Where did those come from?",
          "Alicia found a florist in the city that was still open and picked them up.",
          "All right.",
          "Keep it in your pants. Okay, here we go.",
          "Jake, Amy, let's go downstairs.",
          "It's wedding time!",
          "So here it is.",
          "I really hope you like it.",
          "But if you don't, I will kill myself.",
          "Charles, it looks amazing.",
          "It's beautiful.",
          "How can I ever repay you?",
          "Get pregnant.",
          "Use your body to give the world more Jake.",
          "Holy crap. All right.",
          "I'm gonna take Charles away from you now.",
          "I will see you up there.",
          "Wait! Stop everything. We're here.",
          "Where have you guys been?",
          "You sent us out to find a band.",
          "Right. I definitely remember doing that.",
          "It took a while, but I think we really nailed it.",
          "Check this guy out. We found him on the subway.",
          "Hey, I know you. You're Melipnos.",
          "No. We have never met.",
          "No, I'm pretty sure we have.",
          "You sell me horse blood? No.",
          "Would you like to buy horse blood?",
          "No. You know what?",
          "Maybe we don't need music for this.",

          "Here, watch. Hey, Scully.",
          "Did you know that Amy is super cool?",

          "Unfortunately, Alfonso knows I'm a cop,",

          "Hey, Scully, did you do something new with your hair?",
          "Same thing as always: Put mousse in it",
          "while it's wet, then I watch a scary movie.",

          "Casting's up!",

          "No one cares about this that much.",

          "He was the worst one!",
          "No offense, but Holt was so unconvincing.",
          "He kept referring to his childhood",
          "as a soot-covered street urchin.",
          "Yes, I gave myself a Dickensian backstory,",

          "What does that even mean?",
          "It means you blew it.",

          "Everybody say \"possession with intent to distribute\"!",
          "Hey.",

          "- How are you? - Not great.",
          "Yeah, jail is rough.",
          "You got to go poop in front of everyone.",
          "I remember when I was in prison,",
          "I held it for weeks, and when I finally did go,",
          "it was...",
          "You know what, Jake? This isn't about you.",
          "So, David, did you get fired,",
          "or is there gonna be, like, a hearing?",
          "She's asking so she can be there to support you.",
          "Oh, yeah, I wouldn't miss it.",
          "- I'm so excited. - To support you.",
          "That's what I said. I'm really looking forward",
          "- to being there. - To support you.",
          "Yeah, we're saying the same thing.",
          "- I am pumped this is happening. - All right, babe,",
          "maybe your brother doesn't want to talk about what happened.",
          "- Let's just go. - It's okay.",
          "I owe you guys an explanation.",
          "I actually started doing drugs when I was a teenager.",
          "You know how Mom and Dad put so much pressure on us?",
          "- Eventually I just kind of cracked. - Wait, you felt pressure?",
          "You always seemed to effortlessly thrive",
          "at everything. I was so jealous.",
          "But knowing that you also felt the pressure...",
          "All right, we can drop the act.",
          "I just didn't know who was listening.",
          "- What act, now? - Everything I've said before",
          "just now is a lie. I'm being framed.",
          "I've been investigating these dirty cops",
          "who are being paid off by the Brazilian mob.",
          "Oh, Brazilian mobsters are so good-looking.",
          "They're just a bunch of Giseles, the women and the men.",
          "Yes, it's insane. They're all gorgeous.",
          "Anyway, I think I got too close.",
          "Those dirty cops must have planted the drugs in my desk.",
          "So what you're saying is, you're not addicted to cocaine?",
          "Amy, it's me. I don't even drink coffee.",
          "I have too much respect for my body.",
          "This is water.",
          "And you didn't feel pressure",
          "- from Mom and Dad? - No, they're so supportive.",
          "I'd actually love some constructive criticism.",
          "It's the only way to grow.",
          "Anyway, thank you so much for bailing me out.",
          "If you can just drop me off at home, I will clear my name,",
          "and things can go back to the way they were.",
          "The way they were. Great.",
          "It's my favorite way of things being.",
          "Okay, Alfonso, I hope you like it here in holding.",
          "It's gonna be a while.",
          "- So... what they got you in here for? - Drugs.",
          "They want me to flip, but I'm no snitch.",
          "I'd rather do the time. How about you?",
          "I pushed a man, just to see him frown.",
          "He is terrible.",
          "Yeah, it's almost like casting a robotic old nerd",
          "was a huge mistake.",
          "Was it a mistake, Sarge?",
          "Or was it a stroke of brilliance?",
          "- What are you talking about? - Look, you're a good actor.",
          "You could even be a great one. But you're too gentle.",
          "Life hasn't kicked you around enough.",
          "I mean, I grew up poor, and my father was emotionally abusive.",
          "It's not enough.",
          "You needed to be rejected by me,",
          "a man you admire so much.",
          "What? So all this was just to make me mad?",
          "I need you to feel the anger and resentment",
          "that Tyrone McCallister feels every single day of his life.",
          "Who's Tyrone McCallister?",
          "You are.",
          "That's the part I wrote for you all along.",
          "This is so stupid, Boyle.",
          "You can't manipulate somebody like this",
          "and then expect them to get on board.",
          "Right, Sarge?",
          "Sarge?",
          "My name's Tyrone.",
          "Tyrone McGallagher.",
          "- McCallister. - McCallister.",

          "He passed his drug test.",
          "Apparently he has the cleanest blood they've ever seen.",
          "I knew this was all too good to be true.",
          "Now David's gonna clear his name",
          "and singlehandedly take down drug dealers and dirty cops",
          "and get another medal from the governor.",
          "It sounds pretty dangerous. Maybe we should help him.",
          "Pretty sure he can handle this on his own.",
          "That's never been a problem for him.",
          "All right, look, Ames.",
          "I never had a brother,",
          "but I know four guys who did,",
          "and they would have fights and squabbles,",
          "but in the end, they always had each other's shells.",
          "Are you talking about the Ninja Turtles?",
          "Of course I'm talking about the Ninja Turtles!",
          "Ugh.",
          "Look, if something happens to your brother,",
          "you are gonna regret it,",
          "just like Raph regretted it when he abandoned Leo",
          "in the Technodrome with Krang.",
          "I don't know what that means.",
          "Well, that's on you. It's a classic.",
          "The point is, if your brother gets hurt",
          "and you don't get his back now,",
          "it's gonna haunt you for the rest of your life.",
          "You're right.",
          "- Obviously you're right. - Thank you.",
          "If David gets killed by the Brazilian mafia,",
          "my parents' mantel is gonna become, like,",
          "- a permanent shrine to him. - No, that's not what I meant.",
          "Oh, the thought of it makes me want to puke.",
          "You've learned the wrong lesson.",
          "Come on, let's go help the bastard.",
          "Don't love how we got here, but we're going where I want.",
          "I'm glad you guys are here.",
          "So this place is run by the Brazilian mob.",
          "My CI tells me there's a ledger with all the cops on payroll",
          "hidden in here somewhere.",
          "I'm guessing it's in that room surrounded by armed guards.",
          "Those are guards?",
          "I thought they were models.",
          "We need a plan to get past them.",
          "So here's what I'm thinking. I speak a little Portuguese",
          "from that time I opened a school in the favelas of Rio.",
          "- Ugh, barf. - What?",
          "I said barf.",
          "I can't deal with your bragging anymore.",
          "How is that bragging?",
          "I said I speak a little Portuguese",
          "when I'm actually fluent.",
          "Ugh, shut up!",
          "Look, if you're so angry with me, why are you even here?",
          "Because Jake convinced me if you die,",
          "I'd never hear the end of it from Mom and Dad.",
          "That's not exactly how I phrased it.",
          "Look, I get it. You're jealous.",
          "I'd be jealous too if someone was better than me",
          "at everything their whole life.",
          "- Oh, no. - Not everything.",
          "- I have more allergies than you. - Not the best brag.",

          "Sergeant Knox. We've been talking computers all day.",
